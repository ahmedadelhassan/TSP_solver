===================

Advanced algorithms practice project of MLDM first year students
##Description
The objective of this project is to implement some algorithms for solving **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** 
and to provide an experimental study of their running time and the quality of the outputs as well.
##Alogorithms finished
Program different algorithms for the TSP problem:

1. brute-force approach
2. branch-and-bound
3. ~~adding and removing edges~~ 2-opt
4. the minimum spanning tree 
5. greedy approach
6. randomized approach
7. genetic programming or ant colony approach
8. ~~personal~~ evolution algorithm
