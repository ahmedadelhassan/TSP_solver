===================

Advanced algorithmics pratice project of MLDM first year students
##Description
The objective of this project is to implement some algorithms for solving **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** and to provide an experimental study of their running time and the quality of the outputs as
well.
##Work to do
Program different algorithms for the TSP problem:

1. brute-force approach
2. branch-and-bound
3. adding and removing edges 
4. the minimum spanning tree 
5. greedy approach
6. randomized approach
7. genetic programming or ant colony approach
8. personal
