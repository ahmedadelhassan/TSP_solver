Steps to make the GA algorithm.

- General Parameters:
	* size of population = 2000
	* max number of generation = 5000
	* number of siblings = 5
	* size of each cluster = (size of population) / (number of siblings)
	* number of iterations

- Initialization:
	* initialize the the population with random routes.
	
- For loop over the number of generations
	* Measure the fitness of all solutions we have.
	* The clustering step:
		- Create a new list containing a copy of the whole the population
		- shuffle this new list - randomize it -.
		- choose random samples "clusters".
		- for each cluster, select the top performer in it.
	* Mutation Step
		- For each one of the selected top performers in the previous steps, generate (number of siblings), by looping over the following methods:
			-- switch a random segment
			-- flip the middle segment
			-- point mutations
			-- shift
			-- NOTHING - just make a copy of the parent in the new generation
		and put the new siblings in a "new generation" list.
	* Update the algorithm
